# Future Work

A list of possible future implementation:

- test again the model with a larger amount of data

- apply one-hot encoding on the numerical values of the columns room, building and city since they are continous and that would imply that there’s an order among the values in this category and that this specific order is
  important for the decision making. If the order of a feature’s values is not important, using ordered numbers as values is likely to confuse the learning algorithm,1 because the algorithm will try to find a regularity where there’s no one, which may potentially lead to overfitting.
